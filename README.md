## Naive Bayes Classifier Authorship Attribution
  This project uses a Naive Bayes Classifier in an attempt to determine authorship. It uses a variety of features covering phonetics, sytnax, and readability. This was originally part of my senior seminar project, but I am continuing to work on it. Since finishing the class, I have improved the accuracy from .54 to .73 by qualifying the returned values by each of the functions.
  The data that this project is currently using is the books of Matthew and John from the KJV Bible. I am hoping to eventually scale this project to the entire New Testament to attempt to determine an author for Hebrews.
